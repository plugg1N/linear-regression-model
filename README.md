## üëæ Linear Regression Model

This is my second project on Machine Learning. My first project was commercial - this one is made for educational purpose. This is the task from "–°–∏—Ä–∏—É—Å - –ö—É—Ä—Å—ã –ø–æ –º–∞—à–∏–Ω–Ω–æ–º—É –æ–±—É—á–µ–Ω–∏—é". Task was to create a Machine-Learning **LinearRegression** model

There is a csv file, that represents information *(factors)* that has some hidden relation to G3 (grade in third year)

As I discovered in **"main.ipynb"**, "G1" *(or grade in the first year)* has the biggest correlation coefficient to G3. Also, "age" has second biggest influence on predicted value
